            "content": "Questions and Answers . Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not? No, in some cases it is not a good idea to use a random sample for the validation set. In time series forecasting for example it is not a good idea because taking out some random points for the validation set makes a trend incomplete. In this case, it would be better to cut out multiple a connected series of data points as validation set. . | What is overfitting? Provide an exmaple. The model performs very well on the training set but very poorly on the validation set. It has not learned but memorized. . | What is a metric? How does it differ from &quot;loss&quot;? A metric is used to rate the performance of a model. The loss-function is used within training to determine how well the choosen parameters are. The goal of the algorithms is to minimize the loss-function. Metrics are used by humans while the loss-function is used by computers. . | How can pretrained models help? A pretrained model is a model that was trained using a large dataset. It can be used to solve similar problems using transfer learning. Using a pretrained model decreases the time needed to train the adjusted model. . | What is the &quot;head&quot; of a model? The head of a model is the output layer of a model. . | What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers? The early layers of a CNN find basic structures like colors or lines. The later layers use this basic structures to detec more advanced structures like for example rectangles. . | Are image models only useful for photos? No, many things like for example sound can be converted into an image. . | What is an &quot;architecture&quot;? A template of the model that we&#39;re trying to fit. The actual mathematical function that we&#39;re passing the input data and parameters to. . | What is a segmentation? Segmentation is the process of partitioning the image into different objects. For example the result of a segmentation could be that in an image containing a car and a house, the car is marked as car and the house is marked as house. . | Lessons Learned . Jupyter Notebook . I did not know that it is possible to use Jupyter Notebooks to write a Blog. I also was suprised that Jupyther Notebooks are serialized as JSON. Getting familiar with Google Colab was a bit frustrating at the beginning. Nevertheless I think it is a useful tool to test machine learning libraries in a fast way because many libraries are already preinstalled. . Deep Learning . I already knew that Deep Learning Models are blackboxes, but I didn&#39;t know that there is a variety of tools (Lime, SHAP) that make it possible to (more or less) comprehend how a Deep Learning Model came to a certain conclusion. .",
