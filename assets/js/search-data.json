            "content": "Questions and Answers . Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not? No, in some cases it is not a good idea to use a random sample for the validation set. In time series forecasting for example it is not a good idea because taking out some random points for the validation set makes a trend incomplete. In this case, it would be better to cut out multiple a connected series of data points as validation set. . | What is overfitting? Provie an exmaple. The model performs very well on the training set but very poorly on the validation set. It has not learned but memorized. . | What is a metric? How does it differ from &quot;loss&quot;? A metric is used to rate the performance of a model. The loss-function is used within training to determine how well the choosen parameters are. The goal of the algorithms is to minimize the loss-function. Metrics are used by humans while the loss-function is used by computers. . | How can pretrained models help? A pretrained model is a model that was trained using a large dataset. It can be used to solve similar problems using transfer learning. Using a pretrained model decreases the time needed to train the adjusted model. . | What is the &quot;head&quot; of a model? The head of a model is the output layer of a model. . | What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers? The early layers of a CNN find basic structures like colors or lines. The later layers use this basic structures to detec more advanced structures like for example rectangles. . | Are image models only useful for photos? No, many things like for example sound can be converted into an image. . | What is an &quot;architecture&quot;? A template of the model that we&#39;re trying to fit. The actual mathematical function that we&#39;re passing the input data and parameters to. . | What is a segmentation? Segmentation is the process of partitioning the image into different objects. For example the result of a segmentation could be that in an image containing a car and a house, the car is marked as car and the house is marked as house. . | Lessons Learned . Jupyter Notebook . I did not know that it is possible to use Jupyter Notebooks to write a Blog. I also was suprised that Jupyther Notebooks are serialized as JSON. . Deep Learning . I already knew that Deep Learning Models are blackboxes, but I didn&#39;t know that there is a variety of tools that make it possible to (more or less) comprehend how a Deep Learning Model came to a certain conclusion. .",

braveheart &quot; . xxmaj these are two entirely different films , probably only similar in the fact that they are both about xxmaj scots in historical xxmaj scotland . xxmaj yet , this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems | pos | . 2 xxbos * ! ! - xxup spoilers - ! ! * n n xxmaj before i begin this , let me say that i have had both the advantages of seeing this movie on the big screen and of having seen the &quot; authorized xxmaj version &quot; of this movie , remade by xxmaj stephen xxmaj king , himself , in 1997 . n n xxmaj both advantages made me appreciate this version of &quot; the xxmaj shining , &quot; all the more . n n xxmaj also , let me say that xxmaj i &#39;ve read xxmaj mr . xxmaj king &#39;s book , &quot; the xxmaj shining &quot; on many occasions over the years , and while i love the book and am a huge fan of his work , xxmaj stanley xxmaj kubrick &#39;s retelling of this story is far more compelling … and xxup scary . n n xxmaj kubrick | pos | . 3 xxbos xxmaj some have praised _ xxunk _ as a xxmaj disney adventure for adults . i do n&#39;t think so -- at least not for thinking adults . n n xxmaj this script suggests a beginning as a live - action movie , that struck someone as the type of crap you can not sell to adults anymore . xxmaj the &quot; crack staff &quot; of many older adventure movies has been done well before , ( think _ the xxmaj dirty xxmaj dozen _ ) but _ atlantis _ represents one of the worse films in that motif . xxmaj the characters are weak . xxmaj even the background that each member trots out seems stock and awkward at best . xxmaj an xxup md / xxmaj medicine xxmaj man , a tomboy mechanic whose father always wanted sons , if we have not at least seen these before | neg | . 4 xxbos xxrep 3 * xxmaj warning - this review contains &quot; plot spoilers , &quot; though nothing could &quot; spoil &quot; this movie any more than it already is . xxmaj it really xxup is that bad . xxrep 3 * n n xxmaj before i begin , xxmaj i &#39;d like to let everyone know that this definitely is one of those so - incredibly - bad - that - you - fall - over - laughing movies . xxmaj if you &#39;re in a lighthearted mood and need a very hearty laugh , this is the movie for you . xxmaj now without further ado , my review : n n xxmaj this movie was found in a bargain bin at wal - mart . xxmaj that should be the first clue as to how good of a movie it is . xxmaj secondly , it stars the lame action | neg | . 5 xxbos xxmaj god ! xxmaj zorro has been the the subject of about as many movies as xxmaj tarzan , and probably had about as many actors in the title role . n n xxmaj this xxmaj serial is one of my own personal favourites , and as previously stated , it is one of the xxmaj top 5 xxmaj sound xxmaj serials . xxmaj oddly enough , this is one production that came out in that water shed year of 1939 . * xxmaj by the time of this production in &#39; 39 , xxmaj zorro was really well known as a ( pulp ) literary and movie character . xxmaj the film opens up with a little foot note about the xxmaj history of the xxmaj mexico &#39;s struggle for freedom from rule by a xxmaj european xxmaj monarchy , namely xxmaj spain . xxmaj the story invites comparison | pos | . 6 xxbos xxmaj that word &#39; true &#39; in this film &#39;s title got my alarm bells ringing . xxmaj they rang louder when a title card referred to xxmaj america &#39;s xxmaj civil xxmaj war as the &#39; war xxmaj between the xxmaj states &#39; ( the xxunk preferred by die - hard southerners ) . xxmaj jesse xxmaj james -- thief , slave - holder and murderer -- is described as a quiet , gentle farm boy . n n xxmaj how dishonest is this movie ? xxmaj there is xxup no mention of slavery , far less of the documented fact that xxmaj jesse xxmaj james &#39;s poor xxunk mother owned slaves before the war , and that xxmaj jesse and his brother xxmaj frank actively fought to preserve slavery . xxmaj according to this movie , all those xxmaj civil xxmaj war soldiers were really fighting to decide | neg | . 7 xxbos &quot; a xxmaj damsel in xxmaj distress &quot; is definitely not one of xxmaj fred xxmaj astaire &#39;s better musicals . xxmaj but even xxmaj astaire &#39;s bad films always had some good moments . n n xxmaj in &quot;

good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts . xxmaj it is , in fact , one of the things that has made the character of xxmaj dirty xxmaj harry xxmaj callahan ( as played by xxmaj clint xxmaj eastwood ) so popular . xxmaj he carries a badge and works within the law , but at heart , xxmaj harry is a vigilante , meting out justice ` his &#39; way , which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors , as well as the criminals he &#39;s pursuing . xxmaj but it &#39;s what draws the audience ; anyone who &#39;s ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another , delights in seeing someone cut | pos | . learn = text_classifier_learner(dls, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5, metrics=accuracy) . learn.fine_tune(4, 1e-2) learn.fine_tune(4, 1e-2) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 0.462327 | 0.405238 | 0.816720 | 07:37 | . . 0.00% [0/4 00:00&lt;00:00] epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . . 55.64% [217/390 06:04&lt;04:50 0.3592] &lt;/div&gt;
