            "content": "Questions and Answers . Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not? No, in some cases it is not a good idea to use a random sample for the validation set. In time series forecasting for example it is not a good idea because taking out some random points for the validation set makes a trend incomplete. In this case, it would be better to cut out multiple a connected series of data points as validation set. . | What is overfitting? Provie an exmaple. The model performs very well on the training set but very poorly on the validation set. It has not learned but memorized. . | What is a metric? How does it differ from &quot;loss&quot;? A metric is used to rate the performance of a model. The loss-function is used within training to determine how well the choosen parameters are. The goal of the algorithms is to minimize the loss-function. Metrics are used by humans while the loss-function is used by computers. . | How can pretrained models help? A pretrained model is a model that was trained using a large dataset. It can be used to solve similar problems using transfer learning. Using a pretrained model decreases the time needed to train the adjusted model. . | What is the &quot;head&quot; of a model? The head of a model is the output layer of a model. . | What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers? The early layers of a CNN find basic structures like colors or lines. The later layers use this basic structures to detec more advanced structures like for example rectangles. . | Are image models only useful for photos? No, many things like for example sound can be converted into an image. . | What is an &quot;architecture&quot;? A template of the model that we&#39;re trying to fit. The actual mathematical function that we&#39;re passing the input data and parameters to. . | What is a segmentation? Segmentation is the process of partitioning the image into different objects. For example the result of a segmentation could be that in an image containing a car and a house, the car is marked as car and the house is marked as house. . | Lessons Learned . Jupyter Notebook . I did not know that it is possible to use Jupyter Notebooks to write a Blog. I also was suprised that Jupyther Notebooks are serialized as JSON. . Deep Learning . I already knew that Deep Learning Models are blackboxes, but I didn&#39;t know that there is a variety of tools that make it possible to (more or less) comprehend how a Deep Learning Model came to a certain conclusion. .",

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png . Formatting text as YAML: . key: value - another_key: &quot;another value&quot; . Tables . Column 1 Column 2 . A thing | Another thing | . Tweetcards .
